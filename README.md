**This solution of heat equation inspired by this repositories**

I dont know why, but my own models dont work correctly, so big thanks for published this PINN:

1. https://github.com/314arhaam/heat-pinn
   
2. https://github.com/kiarashshi/PINN-2D-transient-heat-equation

Shall move to my own models, in folder you can find:
1. FDM solution 1d not steay state heat equation
2. PINN 1D not steay state heat equation
3. PINN 2D steady state solution
4. PINN 2D not steady state solution

My own recommendations:
1. How i explore in PINN, if you have not steady state eqution, i recommend make intensify learning on initial condidtion, it is impove sense of physics process.

2. And if you saw your optimization methods can reduce loss even after 10000 epoch, i recommended put more epoch, because it was problem why my 1d not steady state model cannot correct predict process.

Good luck to explore PINN, because in my opinion this idea of implement physics equation in neural networks can really make models more physics interpreted.
